# 3D-Demo

## Developping a 3D-Demo for the Apple ][

This project initially was just for fun. I wanted to check out if the good old Apple II is capable of 3D-graphics and I wanted to learn 6502-assembler. 

A detailed description of the algorithm is available on my homepage [www.golombeck.eu](http://www.golombeck.eu/index.php?id=34&L=1).

There is also a video on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JlC1pkmFg0) for your entertainment!
